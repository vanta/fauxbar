# Fauxbar Screenshots #



## 1. Initial setup ##

When you install Fauxbar for the first time, Fauxbar processes your Chrome history items and bookmarks to create its own separate index. This only takes a moment, and once complete, the index is updated silently on-the-fly from then on.

## 2. Default layout ##

This is the standard Fauxbar layout and styling. The Address Box is on the left; the Search Box is on the right.

In this example, the Address Box is showing a list of top pages from a user's Chrome history and bookmarks.

## 3. Address Box ##

When typing into the Address Box, Fauxbar displays matching pages from your history, bookmarks and opened tabs, with full support for mid-word searching and non-alphanumeric characters.

The above example has the Address Box auto-completing the user's query, based on the highest-ranked matching URL.

This second example above shows how Fauxbar is able to do mid-word searching.

This third example above shows the context menu that appears when you right-click on a result.

This fourth and fifth examples above show how a search engine can be selected and used from the Address Box.

You can also add a keyword (aka tag or label) to a URL. Typing a keyword into Fauxbar's Address Box will always display matching keyworded results first.

## 4. Search Box ##

When a search query is entered in the Search Box (or the Address Box, once a search engine has been selected), past queries and suggestions from the selected search engine can be displayed.

## 5. Adding a search engine to Fauxbar ##

When visiting a site that has a search field, right-click on the search field. If Fauxbar (or Fauxbar Lite) is able to interpret the field's form code, **Fauxbar: Add as search engine** will appear in the right-click context menu.

In this example, Fauxbar Lite has detected that Wolfram|Alpha's input box can be used as a search engine.

Clicking Fauxbar's context menu item will then present a pre-filled pop-up box, letting you edit the search engine's name, keyword and URL if desired, before adding it to Fauxbar.

## 6. Tiles ##

Site tiles can be chosen and arranged automatically, or you can decide which tiles to use, and how they should be placed.

In the above example, a site tile is being clicked and dragged into place.

Installed Chrome apps can also be viewed as tiles.

A condensed version of Fauxbar's Address Box can be accessed from Chrome's Omnibox.

By pressing F and then Spacebar, you can find your history items and bookmarks using Fauxbar from the Omnibox. This can be handy if you don't feel like opening the main Fauxbar page.
