## What is Fauxbar exactly? ##

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/ZHOMS.png' align='right' />

Fauxbar is a free Google Chrome extension that provides a page that acts like Firefox's Awesome Bar.

Main features include:

  * **Address Box:** Precisely find your history items, bookmarks and opened tabs. Results are ranked using Mozilla's frecency algorithm, just like Firefox, with full support for mid-word searching and non-alphanumeric characters. Or, type in a search engine keyword and search the Internet.

  * **Search Box:** Use your favorite websites' search engines within Fauxbar, with the ability to display query suggestions as you type.

  * **Tiles:** Display thumbnails of your top sites and/or installed Chrome apps for quick access.

  * **Omnibox Integration:** Use Fauxbar within Chrome's Omnibox by pressing **F**+**Spacebar**.

  * **Customizable Options:** Change Fauxbar's look, feel and functionality, with over 60 configurable settings, including speech-to-text input, page pre-rendering, colors, fonts, shortcut keys, number of results displayed, and more.

## Where does Fauxbar fit in? ##

Consider the following:

| **Software**        | **Address Bar**  |  **Stability** |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|:---------------|
| ![http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/firefox.png](http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/firefox.png) Firefox Browser |    <font color='green'>✔ Decent</font>      |     <font color='#cc0000'>✘ Poor</font>    |
| ![http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/chrome.png](http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/chrome.png) Chrome Browser  |     <font color='#cc0000'>✘ Poor</font>      |     <font color='green'>✔ Decent</font>   |
| ![http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/fauxbar16.png](http://fauxbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Fauxbar/img/fauxbar16.png) Fauxbar Extension |   <font color='green'>✔ Decent</font>      |     <font color='green'>✔ Decent</font>   |

Firefox's address bar is great, but the browser has stability issues.

Chrome's address bar has issues, but the browser itself is stable.

Enter Fauxbar: a Chrome extension that combines the usability of Firefox's address bar with Chrome's stability.

## Is Fauxbar for me? ##

  * When using Chrome's Omnibox, have you ever typed in part of a page title or address you _know_ you've been to, yet no relevant results appear?

  * Do you find the Omnibox's mix of search suggestions, website suggestions, bookmarks and history items (or lack thereof) confusing?

  * Do you like having the option to click to use a search engine, instead of typing its name to use it?

  * Are you not using Chrome because you can't stand its Omnibox?

If you answered yes, then Fauxbar is for you.

  * [Replacing Chrome’s Omnibox with Fauxbar](http://www.anotherwindowsblog.com/2011/09/replacing-chrome-omnibox-fauxbar.html): "I feel like what Adblock Plus did for me in switching over to Firefox is what Fauxbar is doing for me in switching over to Chrome. It’s surprising how a single addon can have such a major impact on a browser." — _AnotherWindowsBlog_
