# Fauxbar's Features #

**1.** Fauxbar maintains a local mirrored index of your Chrome history and bookmarks, so that finding pages using mid-word searching and non-alphanumeric characters actually works like it should. (using Chrome's History API directly does not support this well)

**2.** Fauxbar makes your New Tab page show a separate Address Box and Search Box, and can also show thumbnails of your top sites and/or installed Chrome Apps.

**3.** Use the Address Box to go to a web page, much like the Omnibox but with more predictable behavior. When you type in parts of a page title or address, Fauxbar displays matching results from your Chrome browsing history, bookmarks and open tabs, with "Switch to tab" functionality. Favicons are also shown for extra readability. The Address Box can also auto-complete the URL you're typing.

**4.** If you enter a search query instead of a URL into the Address Box, the default fallback behavior uses Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature to help you quickly go to what you're after. The fallback address can be changed to Yahoo!, Bing, or any custom engine.

**5.** Fauxbar ranks your history items and bookmarks using Mozilla's frecency algorithm, in a similar manner to Firefox. You can alter the weighting and bonus scores if desired.

**6.** Use Fauxbar's Address Box functionality within Chrome's Omnibox by pressing F and Spacebar.

**7.** Search engines are selectable from the Search Box. As you type, suggestions from the search engine can be displayed (if available), as well as past queries you've entered before.

**8.** To add a new search engine, visit a website containing the search engine you desire, and Fauxbar will ask if you'd like to add it (an orange/blue Fauxbar+ icon will appear within the Omnibox). Works with almost all webpages containing a search input box, even ones that don't use the OpenSearch format.

**9.** Rename, edit or reorder your added search engines with ease. Google, Yahoo! and Bing are added by default.

**10.** If you have a microphone, you can use Chrome's speech-to-text feature in the Address Box and Search Box.

**11.** Fauxbar can override Chrome's Alt+D, Ctrl+L, and Ctrl+K shortcuts on most webpages, so you can avoid using the Omnibox as much as possible and use Fauxbar instead.

**12.** Choose to have either the Address Box, Search Box or Omnibox be focused when Fauxbar opens. You can also swap the position of the Address Box and Search Box, or choose to display only one or the other.

**13.** Easily remove unwanted pages from your Chrome history by pressing Delete when hovering over a result (if Quick Delete is enabled).

**14.** Customize font names, result quantities, shortcuts, styles, sizes and colors for all aspects of Fauxbar, including custom background images, so you can make Fauxbar fit in with your desktop or Chrome theme.

**15.** Backup, restore or reset your Fauxbar options in a snap.
